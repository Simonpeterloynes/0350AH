90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The pipe symbols (|) inside the text signify the
    end of the lines in the PDF. I didn’t delete them. 2- The editorial
    section at the end of the book is the note of the scribe. (Notes from
    validator - Aslisho Qurboniev: I have added  worldcat links here. The
    scribes note at the end of the volume was changed to PARATEXT. I also
    deleted the pipe symbols as  they served no purpose in th edigital
    text).
    NB: check lines of poetry that seem too short: line numbers 5568
