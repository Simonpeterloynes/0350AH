90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- I used a different edition for collation. The only
    difference was that pages 127-128 of the PDF appear in a different place
    in the Editpro text (i.e. in pages 166-169 of the text). 2- According to
    the Book’s table of contents, the beginning of the third section is page
    172 of the PDF (214 of the text), not page 181. 3- The editorial section
    at the end of the book is the note of the scribe.
