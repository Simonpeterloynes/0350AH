90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- Redundant parts: a few redundant lines in PageV01P375-6; PageV05P413 number 1915; A few lines in PageV09P467; Numbers 2344-2349 in PageV08P512 are repeated. I just untagged these redundant numbers (I’m not allowed to delete anything). 2- Numbers 737-747 in PageV08P166 ff appear in wrong order and NO 2233 in PageV08P488 is lost, but these are the mistakes in the PDF, not the text. 3- A lot of numbers were not automatically tagged. I checked all numbers and tagged all of them. 4- PageV09P467 and PageV01P375 are the notes of the scribe. 6- The categorization is continued until sixth-level header. 7- From PageV02P039 onwards (i.e. the beginning of alphabetical order of names), all titles are subcategories of the previous title (in PageV02P037); so they must actually start with fourth-level header; but this will cause the categorization to go up until 8th-level header. So, I restarted tagging the titles from second-level header.
