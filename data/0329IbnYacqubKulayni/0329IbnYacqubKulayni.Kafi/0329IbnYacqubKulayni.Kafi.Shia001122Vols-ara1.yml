90#VERS#ANNOTATOR: Abdelrahman Mahmoud (SHARIAsource-CnC)
90#VERS#COMMENT##: The subsections (bab) are not annotated; had to manually annotate each one of them. Footnote numbers are embedded in the text. A cautionary note appended to volume 1 appears on the digital text from pp. 549. An appendix also appears on pp. 675 in volume 2. A new numbering beginning with 4700 appears from pp. 230 till pp. 246 in Vol. 3 that doesn't exist in the pdf version. I left the title pages in Vol. 4 & 5 as they are since they are already numbered in the digital text. They differ from the pdf version only in that it is published by a different publishing house. On pp. 19 and 22 in Vol. 5, two url links to cited Quranic verses were embedded in the text. All the footnotes appear as endnotes after pp. 408 of Vol. 8. I deleted all of them. I also deleted all the title pages. In Vol. 8, instead of the "tabwib" division scheme, this "kitab" is divided into topical themes under the rubric of the last "kitab," kitab al-rawda. I marked these topical sub-chapters the same way I marked the "babs" in the previous volumes. I have also retained the appendix to Vol. 8 which appears to be a concluding letter by al-Kulayni to his companions [SPL marked as an Appendix - a specialist should decide whether it should be retained or not]. Despite these flaws, this version's accuracy is quite phenomenal given how large the text is.[SPL: Abdelrahman removed/dealt with all of the aformentioned issues.]
