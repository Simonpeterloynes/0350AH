90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- There is no data in METADATA section that shows
    which edition is used. Although the edition I have used is different
    from the Editpro edition, it is very similar to it and I didn’t see any
    major differences. Another (different) edition can be found here:
    https://www.libraryofarabicliterature.org/assets/Gruendler-The-Life-and-
    Times-of-Abu-Tammam-Arabic-only-1.pdf. 2- The first treatise (“رسالة
    الصولي إلى مزاحم بن فاتك”) in the PDF has a title in the beginning of
    the text but it has no content. I guess that it must have been
    intentionally removed from the text by our corpus manager since it is
    not part of the main text. So I do not consider it a missing part.
