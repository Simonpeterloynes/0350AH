90#VERS#COMMENT##: 1- The link in VERS#LINKS leads you to a payment-based website and you must have an account to see the contents (if you can’t access this link, a different edition of the book can be found here: https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikisource/ar/0/08/%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83_%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83.pdf; Although, this is another edition. It might be useful). 2- The text has been annotated. Nevertheless, there is a descriptive Table of contents at the end of the book whose titles could be added to the text to make the structure of the book much more accurate. However, this is just a suggestion and I didn’t do it, since the text lacks these descriptive titles and I’m not allowed to add anything to the text (they must be added by anyone who reads the text closely). 3- You can also find a manuscript of the book here: https://www.alukah.net/manu/files/manuscript_8917/almsaluk-walmumalik-1.pdf
